# Lansing.Love

Lansing.Love is a community web project showcasing how Lansing gives back to its residents. It flips the narrative from "love Lansing" to "how Lansing loves us."

## Goals
- Highlight upcoming events, volunteer opportunities, and local resources.
- Encourage residents to share stories about positive experiences in the city.
- Coordinate with [Fledge DAO](https://fledge.foundation) on community initiatives.

## Technologies Used
The site is currently a simple static site built with HTML, CSS and a small amount of JavaScript. Future plans include optional Web3 features powered by the [Polygon Network](https://polygon.technology).

## Future Web3 Integration
- Community submissions could be verified and stored on-chain for transparency.
- Nonâ€‘fungible tokens (NFTs) and collaboration tokens may be used to reward participation.
- Polygon's low transaction costs make it a good choice for these features.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Serve the site locally with a static server. Examples:
   - **Python**: `python3 -m http.server`
   - **Node**: `npx serve .`
3. Open `http://localhost:8000` (or the port shown in your terminal) in a browser.

No additional dependencies are required for the static site.

## Hosting
The site is deployed through the Fledge DAO infrastructure and may also be mirrored on decentralized hosting (e.g., IPFS) in the future. Keep an eye on this repo for updates about Polygon integration and other community links.
